# Word Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description  
**Word Tic-Tac-Toe** is an innovative twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Instead of using "X" or "O", players place **letters** on a 3x3 grid to form valid words. This version introduces a linguistic challenge to the traditional game mechanics, combining strategy and vocabulary skills.  

### How to Play  
1. The game board consists of a **3x3 grid**.  
2. **Players take turns** placing one letter on the board.  
3. A player must try to form a **valid word** with each move.  
4. Words can be formed **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally**.  
5. Players can **build upon existing letters** on the board to form words, provided that the resulting sequence is a valid word.  

### GUI Features  
- The game includes a **virtual touch keyboard** in the GUI, allowing players to easily select and place letters on the grid.

## Winning the Game  
- The game is won by forming a valid word **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally**.  
- If the board fills up without any valid word being formed, the game ends in a **draw**.

## Dictionary File  
The game uses a file named **`dic.txt`** containing all valid **3-letter words**. Make sure to place this file in the game's root directory for proper functionality.
